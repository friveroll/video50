This is CS50 Video.
---

Video50 is an extensible video player that allows a variety of question types to be embedded at specific timecodes and supports transcripts for multiple languages.

# Player

To create a new CS50 Video player, instantiate a new `CS50.Video` object:

    var player = new CS50.Video({
        aspectRatio: 720 / 480,
        autostart: true,
        defaultVideo: '720p',
        playerContainer: '#video',
        questions: questions,
        srt: {
            en: 'week0w-en.srt',
            pt: 'week0w-pt.srt'
        },
        title: 'Lecture 0: Wednesday',
        video: {
            '360p': '2011/fall/lectures/0/week0f.mp4',
            '720p': '2011/fall/lectures/0/week0w.mp4'
        },
        streamUrl: 'rtmp://stream.cs50.net/cfx/st/',
        videoUrl: 'http://cdn.cs50.net/'
    });

The options object passed to the `CS50.Video` constructor can define the following keys:

* `aspectRatio`: Aspect ratio for the video
* `autostart`: True to start video automatically, false otherwise
* `checkUrl`: URL to be used for checking the answers to questions remotely
* `defaultLanguage`: Default language for transcript and subtitles
* `defaultVideo`: If using multiple video URLs, the video to play by default
* `playbackRates`: List of supported playback rates
* `playerContainer`: Container to render player within
* `playerOptions`: Additional options to pass to the video player
* `mixpanelKey`: API key for Mixpanel analytics
* `questions`: List of questions to be displayed during video
* `srt`: Object mapping languages to SRT file locations
* `streamUrl`: Base URL for RTMP streaming
* `survey50`: Survey ID if using survey50 integration for server-side question checking
* `swf`: SWF file to fall back on for unsupported browsers
* `title`: Title of Video
* `user`: User object for analytics tracking
* `video`: String of single video URL, or object containing multiple video URLs (if using RTMP streaming, this must be relative to streamUrl and videoUrl)
* `videoUrl`: Only used if using RTMP streaming; base URL for video file

Of these keys, `playerContainer` and `video` are required.

# Questions

A question is represented by an object with the following required keys:

* `timecode`: Second of the video at which question should become available.
* `question`: Object representing the question to be displayed. This object must contain at least an `id` representing the unique identifier for the question, a `render` function that will be called in order to display the question, and an array of `tags` that describe the topics covered by the question. Information specific to a question type, such as a `question` and an `answer`, must also be defined in this object.

Questions are displayed to the user via a question rendering method. A question rendering method will be passed the following parameters from the `CS50.Video` object:

* `video`: CS50 Video instance that has created the question.
* `container`: The container to render the question within.
* `data`: An object containing the data necessary to display the question.
* `callback`: A callback function that must be called when the question is answered, for server-side logging purposes.

The question renderer is then responsible for manipulating the DOM to allow users to interact with the question and informing them whether or not their answer is correct. To create a new question type, simply define a new rendering method and set that method as the `render` parameter in the question object. Check out the existing question types for examples.
